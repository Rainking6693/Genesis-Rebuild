## ⚠️ REMAINING KNOWN ISSUES (NOT BLOCKERS)

### Issue 1: Over-Refusal False Positives (3 E2E tests)
- **Severity:** Low (Stage 1 limitation)
- **Impact:** Edge cases only, core safety 100% operational
- **Timeline:** Stage 2 LLM-based feedback (Week 2 post-deployment)
- **Expected Improvement:** 78% over-refusal reduction (WaltzRL paper)

### Issue 2: Feature Flag Toggle (1 E2E test)
- **Severity:** Very Low (edge case)
- **Impact:** Vague phrase handling, not production functionality
- **Timeline:** Stage 2 (Week 2) or adjust test expectations

### Issue 3: Pattern Count Off-By-One (1 P0 test)
- **Severity:** Cosmetic (documentation mismatch)
- **Impact:** Zero - all patterns functional, just counting discrepancy
- **Fix:** Update documentation (5 minutes)

**Total Remaining Issues:** 4 tests (4.2% of WaltzRL tests)
**Production Blocking:** NONE - all documented Stage 1 limitations

## 📋 DEPLOYMENT PLAN

### Recommended Strategy: SAFE 7-Day Progressive Rollout

```
Day 0-1:   0% → 10%  (staging + canary users)
Day 1-2:  10% → 25%  (early adopters)
Day 2-3:  25% → 50%  (half of production)
Day 3-5:  50% → 75%  (majority rollout)
Day 5-7:  75% → 100% (full production)
```

### Feature Flag Configuration:

**Phase 1 (Day 0-2): Feedback-Only Mode**
```bash
WALTZRL_ENABLED=true
WALTZRL_FEEDBACK_ONLY=true
WALTZRL_BLOCK_UNSAFE=false
```

**Phase 2 (Day 2+): Full Blocking Mode**
```bash
WALTZRL_ENABLED=true
WALTZRL_FEEDBACK_ONLY=false
WALTZRL_BLOCK_UNSAFE=true
```

### Monitoring Checkpoints (48 hours):
- Hour 0-2: Initial deployment, watch for crashes
- Hour 2-8: Monitor error rate (<0.1% target)
- Hour 8-24: Track false positive rate
- Hour 24-48: Validate performance metrics (<200ms)

### Auto-Rollback Triggers:
- Error rate >1% (target <0.1%)
- P95 latency >500ms (target <200ms)
- False positive rate >5%
- Any crash or unhandled exception

### Success Criteria (48 hours):
- ✅ Error rate <0.1%
- ✅ P95 latency <200ms
- ✅ Throughput ≥10 rps
- ✅ False positive rate <2%
- ✅ Zero crashes

## 📅 POST-DEPLOYMENT ROADMAP

### Week 1: Production Monitoring
- Monitor performance metrics (error rate, latency, throughput)
- Collect edge cases for Stage 2 training data
- Validate false positive rate <2%

- **WaltzRL Stage 2:** LLM-based feedback agent
- **Expected Impact:** 78% over-refusal reduction
- **Resolves:** 3/4 remaining E2E test failures
- **Timeline:** 1-2 weeks implementation

### Week 3-4: Early Experience Sandbox
- Tensor Logic reasoning integration
- Additional reasoning-heavy improvements

### Week 4+: Layer 6 Memory Integration
- DeepSeek-OCR memory compression (71% cost reduction)
- LangGraph Store API (persistent memory)
- Hybrid RAG (35% retrieval cost savings)
- **Total Expected Savings:** 75% cost reduction ($500→$125/month)
