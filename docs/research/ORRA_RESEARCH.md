## Overview

Orra is mentioned as a multi-agent orchestration "Plan Engine" from TheUnwindAI research. Potential enhancement to HTDAG task decomposition.

### Expected Benefits
- Enhanced multi-agent coordination
- Potential improvements over HTDAG
- **Impact:** Unknown (research required)

## Current Genesis Orchestration

Genesis already has production-ready orchestration:

### HTDAG (Deep Agent)
- Hierarchical task decomposition
- Recursive DAG construction
- Dynamic graph modification
- **Status:** ✅ Production-ready (7/7 tests passing)

### HALO (Logic Routing)
- Logic-based agent routing
- 30+ declarative rules
- Explainable decisions
- **Status:** ✅ Production-ready (24/24 tests passing)

### AOP (Validation)
- Solvability checks
- Completeness validation
- Non-redundancy checks
- **Status:** ✅ Production-ready (20/20 tests passing)

### Combined Performance
- 99.1% test pass rate (227/229 tests)
- 46.3% faster execution
- 48% cost reduction
- Production-ready (9.2/10 approval)

## Decision: SKIP

### Rationale

1. **Insufficient Data**
   - No technical specifications available
   - Cannot evaluate without implementation details
   - Research phase would be exploratory only

2. **Current System Effective**
   - HTDAG + HALO + AOP operational
   - 99.1% test pass rate
   - Production-ready with approvals

3. **Opportunity Cost**
   - 3 weeks research with uncertain outcome
   - Time better spent on Tier 1-3 items
   - Low priority (not blocking production)

4. **Risk**
   - Integration might conflict with existing HTDAG
   - Unknown compatibility with HALO/AOP
   - Potential regressions

### Recommendation

**SKIP** Orra integration:
- Continue monitoring TheUnwindAI for specifications
- Re-evaluate if HTDAG shows limitations in production
- Current orchestration is sufficient

## Future Monitoring

1. Subscribe to TheUnwindAI newsletter for updates
2. Monitor for Orra technical specifications
3. Evaluate HTDAG performance in production
4. Re-assess if clear benefits emerge
