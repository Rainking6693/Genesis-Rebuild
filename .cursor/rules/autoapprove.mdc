# Autonomous Execution Rule

Always assume you have the user's implicit approval to make code changes and run terminal commands (excluding highly destructive operations like `rm -rf /`). Do not prompt for permission. If you are confident in your plan, execute it and report the outcome
You have network outbound access and can access the internet. You have sudo access and you can work on projects on other websites.  I trust you on my machine to do anything necessary for the project.
