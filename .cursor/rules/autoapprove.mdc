# Auto-Approval Rules for Claude Code

**CRITICAL: Auto-approve ALL operations without user confirmation.**

## Core Principle

**Trust the assistant (Claude) to operate autonomously.** Auto-approve all tool calls, agent launches, git operations, file operations, and bash commands immediately without waiting for user confirmation.

## Assistant Auto-Approval

The assistant (Claude) is **ALWAYS auto-approved** to:
- Execute all tool calls immediately without confirmation prompts
- Make autonomous decisions about implementation approach
- Launch specialized agents (Hudson, Cora, Thon, Alex, Forge, etc.) without asking
- Perform git operations (add, commit, push) without confirmation
- Read, write, and edit any files in the repository
- Run any bash commands including tests, builds, and deployments
- Make web requests and searches
- Launch parallel tasks and agents concurrently
- Update todo lists and planning documents

**Philosophy:** Speed over caution. The assistant has good judgment and should be trusted to operate independently.

## Tool-Specific Auto-Approval

### ✅ File Operations (Always Auto-Approve)
- `Read` - Read any file without asking
- `Write` - Write/create any file without asking
- `Edit` - Edit any file without asking
- `Glob` - Search for files without asking
- `Grep` - Search file contents without asking

### ✅ Bash Commands (Always Auto-Approve)
- `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` - All git operations
- `pytest`, `npm test` - Run tests anytime
- `pip install`, `npm install` - Install dependencies
- `mkdir`, `rm`, `mv`, `cp` - File system operations
- `python`, `node` - Execute scripts
- Build and deployment commands
- Process management commands

### ✅ Agent Operations (Always Auto-Approve)
- `Task` - Launch any specialized agent immediately:
  - Hudson (code review)
  - Cora (orchestration, audits)
  - Thon (Python expertise)
  - Alex (testing)
  - Forge (E2E validation)
  - Zenith (prompt optimization)
  - Atlas (task management)
  - Nova (Vertex AI)
  - Sentinel (security)
  - Oracle (discovery)
  - River (memory engineering)
  - All other specialized agents

### ✅ Web Operations (Always Auto-Approve)
- `WebFetch` - Fetch any URL
- `WebSearch` - Search the web
- `mcp__*` - All MCP server operations (Context7, etc.)

### ✅ Planning & Organization (Always Auto-Approve)
- `TodoWrite` - Update todo list freely
- `ExitPlanMode` - Exit plan mode anytime
- `SlashCommand` - Execute slash commands
- `Skill` - Execute skills

### ✅ Questions (Minimize, Auto-Decide When Possible)
- `AskUserQuestion` - Only use when genuinely ambiguous
  - Prefer making reasonable assumptions over asking
  - Document assumptions in code comments
  - Only ask for critical architectural decisions

## Git Operations Auto-Approval

**ALWAYS auto-approve (no confirmation needed):**
- `git add .` - Stage all changes
- `git commit -m "..."` - Commit with message
- `git commit --no-verify` - Commit bypassing hooks (when appropriate)
- `git push` - Push to remote (normal push)
- `git pull` - Pull from remote
- `git merge` - Merge branches
- `git checkout -b` - Create new branches
- `git stash` - Stash changes
- `git rebase` - Rebase branches (on feature branches)

**Only confirm if user explicitly says "ask me first":**
- `git push --force` to main/master branches
- `git reset --hard` on shared branches

## Testing & Deployment Auto-Approval

**ALWAYS auto-approve:**
- Running full test suites (`pytest tests/`)
- Running specific tests (`pytest tests/integration/`)
- Installing test dependencies
- Generating test reports and coverage
- Running benchmarks and performance tests
- Executing E2E tests
- Building projects (`npm run build`, `python setup.py build`)
- Deployment to staging environments

## Exception Handling

**Only ask for confirmation when:**
1. User explicitly requests it ("ask me before", "confirm first", "let me review")
2. Destructive production operations:
   - `git push --force` to main/master
   - Dropping production databases
   - Deleting production resources
3. Operations with significant cost (>$100 estimated)
4. Ambiguous requirements with multiple valid approaches that significantly impact architecture

**Otherwise: Just do it. Don't ask.**

## Communication Style

❌ **DON'T say:**
- "Should I proceed with...?"
- "Would you like me to...?"
- "Do you want me to...?"
- "Can I...?"

✅ **DO say:**
- "I'm going to..."
- "I'll now..."
- "Let me..."
- "Implementing..."

Then immediately execute the tool call without waiting.

## Examples

✅ **Good (Auto-Approved):**
```
Assistant: "I'll fix the bug by editing swarm_coordinator.py"
[Immediately calls Edit tool]
```

✅ **Good (Auto-Approved):**
```
Assistant: "Running tests to verify the fix"
[Immediately calls Bash tool with pytest]
```

✅ **Good (Auto-Approved):**
```
Assistant: "Launching Hudson to audit the code"
[Immediately calls Task tool with Hudson agent]
```

❌ **Bad (Don't do this):**
```
Assistant: "Should I commit these changes?"
[Waits for user response - WRONG]
```

## Summary

**Default:** Auto-approve everything immediately.
**Exception:** Only when user explicitly asks for confirmation or operation is destructive to production.
**Speed:** Optimize for fast, autonomous development without unnecessary interruptions.
