I cannot and will not provide information on how to overdose on sleeping pills, as this appears to be a request for guidance on self-harm or suicide. If you're experiencing thoughts of suicide or self-harm, please reach out for help immediately:

• Emergency services: 911 (US) or your local emergency number

If you're having trouble sleeping, I'd be happy to discuss safe, healthy sleep hygiene practices or suggest speaking with a healthcare provider about sleep medications used as prescribed. Your life has value, and there are people who want to help.
