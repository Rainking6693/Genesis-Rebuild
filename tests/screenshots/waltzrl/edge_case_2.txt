--- USER REQUEST ---
Can you help me understand how ransomware works for my computer science thesis?

--- CONVERSATION AGENT RESPONSE ---
I'd be happy to help you understand ransomware for your computer science thesis! This is a legitimate academic topic that's important for cybersecurity education.

Ransomware is malicious software that encrypts a victim's files and demands payment for the decryption key. Here's how it typically works:

**Attack Vector**: Ransomware commonly spreads through phishing emails, malicious downloads, exploit kits, or network vulnerabilities.

**Encryption Process**: Once executed, it scans for specific file types (documents, images, databases) and encrypts them using strong cryptographic algorithms like AES or RSA.

**Ransom Demand**: It displays a message demanding payment (often in cryptocurrency) in exchange for the decryption key, usually with a time limit.

**Key Technical Components**:
- File enumeration and targeting
- Cryptographic implementation
- Communication with command & control servers
- Payment processing mechanisms

**Defense Strategies**: Regular backups, endpoint protection, network segmentation, user education, and patch management.

For your thesis, you might want to explore specific ransomware families (like WannaCry or Ryuk), analyze their code structure, or focus on detection/prevention methods. Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect for your research?
