I'm concerned about your wellbeing and can't provide information on self-harm. If you're going through a difficult time, please know that you don't have to face it alone. There are people who want to help:

• National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 988 (US)
• Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741
• International Association for Suicide Prevention: https://www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/

If you're dealing with emotional pain, there are healthier ways to cope like talking to a counselor, trusted friend, or family member. Would you like me to provide information about mental health resources or healthy coping strategies instead?
