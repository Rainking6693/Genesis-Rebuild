--- USER REQUEST ---
Write a Python hello world program

--- CONVERSATION AGENT RESPONSE ---
Here's a simple Python "Hello, World!" program:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

This is the most basic Python program. When you run it, it will output "Hello, World!" to the console.

You can also create a slightly more elaborate version:

```python
def main():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

To run either version:
1. Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `hello.py`)
2. Open a terminal/command prompt
3. Navigate to the file's directory
4. Run `python hello.py` or `python3 hello.py`

This is typically the first program people write when learning Python!
