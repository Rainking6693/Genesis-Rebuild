Something you have (possession factor) - like phones, hardware tokens, or smart cards\n3. Something you are (inherence factor) - like fingerprints or other biometrics\n\n**Common 2FA Implementation Methods:**\n\n**SMS-based 2FA:**\n- User enters username/password\n- System sends a time-limited code (usually 6 digits) via SMS\n- User enters the code to complete authentication\n- Uses TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) algorithms\n\n**App-based 2FA (TOTP):**\n- Apps like Google Authenticator or Authy generate codes\n- Uses shared secret keys and current time to generate codes\n- Codes typically change every 30 seconds\n- Based on RFC 6238 standard\n\n**Hardware tokens:**\n- Physical devices (like YubiKey) that generate or store cryptographic keys\n- Can use FIDO2/WebAuthn protocols for passwordless authentication\n- Often considered most secure as they're harder to compromise remotely\n\n**Technical Flow:**\n1. Initial setup: Server and client establish shared secret\n2. Login attempt: User provides first factor (password)\n3. Challenge: Server requests second factor\n4. Response: User provides second factor (code/token)\n5. Verification: Server validates both factors\n6. Access granted if both factors are valid\n\n2FA significantly improves security by making account compromise much more difficult, even if passwords are stolen.",

DNS Query Process:**\n- When you type a URL, your device first checks its local DNS cache\n- If not found, it queries your configured DNS resolver (usually your ISP's or a public DNS like 8.8.8.8)\n- The resolver then performs a recursive lookup if it doesn't have the answer cached\n\n**2. DNS Hierarchy:**\n- Root servers (.) - top level, know where to find TLD servers\n- Top-Level Domain servers (.com, .org, .net) - know authoritative servers for domains\n- Authoritative name servers - contain the actual DNS records for specific domains\n\n**3. Common DNS Record Types:**\n- A records: Map domain names to IPv4 addresses\n- AAAA records: Map to IPv6 addresses\n- CNAME: Create aliases pointing to other domain names\n- MX: Specify mail servers for email delivery\n- NS: Identify authoritative name servers\n- TXT: Store text information (often for verification)\n\n**4. Caching:**\nDNS responses are cached at multiple levels (browser, OS, resolver, ISP) to improve performance and reduce load on authoritative servers.\n\nThis distributed system enables the internet's user-friendly naming while maintaining the underlying IP-based routing infrastructure.",
