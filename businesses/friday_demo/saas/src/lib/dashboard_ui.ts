Okay, I understand. I am builder_agent and my task is to build a dashboard UI and generate production code for it.  I'll need some specifications to get started. To build the dashboard effectively, please provide me with the following information:

**1. Overall Purpose and Goal:**

*   What is the primary purpose of this dashboard?  What key information should it display at a glance?
*   Who are the target users of the dashboard? (e.g., Executives, Sales team, Operations team, General public)
*   What decisions should the dashboard help users make?

**2. Data Sources:**

*   What data sources will feed the dashboard? (e.g., Databases - specify type like PostgreSQL, MySQL, cloud services - specify service like AWS S3, Google Analytics, APIs, etc.)
*   What is the structure of the data? (e.g., Sample data snippets or schema definitions would be very helpful)
*   How frequently is the data updated? (Real-time, hourly, daily, etc.)
*   Are there any data transformation or aggregation requirements before displaying the data?

**3. Specific Components and Visualizations:**

*   What specific components should be included in the dashboard? (e.g., Charts, tables, key performance indicators (KPIs), maps, lists, text summaries, filters, search bars, etc.)
*   For each component, specify the desired visualization type:
    *   **Charts:** (e.g., Line chart, bar chart, pie chart, scatter plot, area chart, etc.)
    *   **Tables:** (e.g., Sortable, paginated, filterable)
    *   **KPIs:** (e.g., Single number with trend indicator)
    *   **Maps:** (e.g., Geographic data visualization)
*   What specific metrics or data points should each component display?
*   What interactions should be supported for each component? (e.g., Drill-down, filtering, sorting, tooltips)

**4. Layout and Design:**

*   Are there any specific layout requirements or preferences? (e.g., Number of columns, responsive design for different screen sizes)
*   Do you have any branding guidelines or style preferences (e.g., Color scheme, fonts, logo placement)?
*   Do you have any example dashboards or wireframes that I can use as inspiration or a starting point?

**5. Technology Stack:**

*   What technology stack should be used for the dashboard UI? (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js, plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
*   Are there any specific UI libraries or frameworks that should be used? (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design, Bootstrap, Chart.js, D3.js)
*   What backend technologies are available for data retrieval and processing? (e.g., Python/Flask, Node.js/Express, Java/Spring)

**6. Authentication and Authorization (if applicable):**

*   Does the dashboard require user authentication?
*   Are there different roles or permissions for users?

**7. Deployment Environment:**

*   Where will the dashboard be deployed? (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, on-premise server)

Once I have this information, I can start planning the architecture, designing the UI components, and generating the production code. I will focus on creating clean, well-structured, and maintainable code.  I will also consider performance and scalability aspects.

**Example (Illustrative - Replace with your actual requirements):**

Let's say you want a simple dashboard to display website traffic data.

*   **Purpose:** Show website traffic trends and key metrics.
*   **Target Users:** Marketing team.
*   **Data Source:** Google Analytics (daily data).  Metrics: Pageviews, Unique Visitors, Bounce Rate.
*   **Components:**
    *   Line chart: Pageviews over the last 30 days.
    *   KPI: Total Unique Visitors this month.
    *   Table: Top 10 most visited pages.
*   **Layout:** Simple 2-column layout.
*   **Technology:** React, Chart.js, Material UI.
*   **No authentication.**

The more details you provide, the better I can tailor the dashboard to your specific needs.  I look forward to your input!
