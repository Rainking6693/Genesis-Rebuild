4. **Cost Validation** (Days 6-7)
   - Run 100-business simulation
   - Measure token usage before/after compression
   - Validate 71% reduction target
   - Document compression ratios by age

### **WEEK 3: Hybrid RAG for Semantic Retrieval (Nov 5-11)**

**Owner:** River (RAG architecture), Nova (Vertex AI integration)

**Deliverables:**
1. **Vector Database Setup** (Days 1-2)
   - Choose vector DB (Pinecone free tier OR Weaviate local)

   - Create vector indices for:
     - Agent memories (past successful solutions)
     - Business procedures (verified workflows)
     - Evolution trajectories (Darwin improvements)

2. **Hybrid RAG Implementation** (Days 3-4)
   - **Vector search:** Similarity-based retrieval (e.g., "similar bug fixes")
   - **Graph search:** Relationship-based retrieval (e.g., "agents who worked on this business")
   - Combine results with reciprocal rank fusion
   - Implement Agentic RAG pattern:
     ```python
     async def retrieve_relevant_memories(query):
         # Vector search
         similar = await vector_db.search(embed(query), top_k=5)

         # Graph search
         related = await mongodb.find({
             "$or": [
                 {"business_id": current_business},
                 {"agent_id": {"$in": collaborators}}
             ]
         })

         # Fusion
         return reciprocal_rank_fusion(similar, related)
     ```

3. **Cross-Business Learning** (Day 5)
   - Implement memory sharing between businesses
   - Privacy controls (only share consensus memories, not raw data)

New cost: $216 - $64 = $152/month
```

### **After Week 3 (Hybrid RAG):**
```
