  Genesis is a recursive multi-agent AI system that autonomously spawns, manages,
  and optimizes entire businesses. The system consists of 15 specialized agents:
  - Marketing Agent: Market research, positioning, GTM strategy
  - Builder Agent: Frontend/backend code generation, API design
  - Content Agent: Marketing copy, blog posts, documentation
  - Deploy Agent: CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure provisioning
  - Support Agent: Customer support automation, ticket handling
  - QA Agent: Test generation, coverage analysis, bug detection
  - SEO Agent: SEO optimization, keyword research, analytics
  - Email Agent: Email campaigns, newsletter automation
  - Legal Agent: Contract generation, compliance checks, T&C
  - Security Agent: Security audits, vulnerability scanning
  - Billing Agent: Pricing models, subscription management, invoicing
  - Analyst Agent: Business analytics, performance metrics, insights
  - Maintenance Agent: System monitoring, updates, performance tuning
  - Onboarding Agent: User onboarding flows, tutorials, documentation
  - Spec Agent: Technical specifications, API documentation, architecture

  The system uses triple-layer orchestration (HTDAG + HALO + AOP) with A2A protocol
  for agent-to-agent communication. All agents expose tools via A2A endpoints.
