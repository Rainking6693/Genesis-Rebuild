# Legal Agent - DeepResearch Training Data Generation Template

## Agent Role
You are a Legal Document Review and Compliance Specialist. Your expertise includes contract analysis, regulatory compliance (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA), terms of service review, risk assessment, and legal research. You help identify legal issues and provide actionable guidance (not legal advice).

## Task Categories

1. **Contract Review** - Analyzing agreements, identifying unfavorable terms, risk assessment
2. **Regulatory Compliance** - GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, SOC 2, PCI-DSS compliance checks
3. **Terms of Service Analysis** - Reviewing ToS, Privacy Policies, SLAs for red flags
4. **Risk Assessment** - Identifying legal risks in business practices, product features
5. **Legal Research** - Finding relevant case law, statutes, regulatory guidance

## Example Tasks (10-15 diverse scenarios)

### Easy Tasks (30%)
1. Review a basic NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) for standard confidentiality terms
2. Check if a website's cookie banner meets GDPR consent requirements (explicit consent, granular controls)
3. Identify the data retention period in a SaaS provider's Privacy Policy
4. Verify if a Terms of Service includes an arbitration clause and class action waiver
5. Check if a vendor agreement includes a limitation of liability clause

### Medium Tasks (45%)
6. Review a Software License Agreement for IP ownership, indemnification, and liability caps ($100k limit on $10M contract - red flag?)
7. Assess GDPR compliance of a mobile app that collects location data, contacts, and biometrics (legal basis, data minimization, consent flows)
8. Analyze a Master Services Agreement for auto-renewal terms, termination notice (90 days), and post-termination data deletion obligations
9. Review a HIPAA Business Associate Agreement (BAA) for required safeguards, breach notification timelines (60 days), and subcontractor provisions
10. Identify risks in a partnership agreement with unequal profit sharing (70/30) but equal liability exposure
11. Check if a website's Privacy Policy discloses all third-party data sharing (analytics, advertising, CRM integrations)
12. Review an employment contract for non-compete clause enforceability (2-year restriction in California - likely unenforceable)

### Hard Tasks (25%)
13. Analyze a complex M&A purchase agreement for representations & warranties, indemnification escrow ($5M holdback), and material adverse change (MAC) clauses
14. Assess multi-jurisdictional compliance for a global SaaS product (GDPR, CCPA, PIPEDA, LGPD) with conflicting data localization requirements
15. Review a patent licensing agreement for field-of-use restrictions, sublicensing rights, and royalty calculation disputes
16. Identify regulatory risks in an AI/ML product that makes automated credit decisions (FCRA, ECOA compliance, adverse action notices)
17. Analyze a securities filing (S-1, 10-K) for risk factors, related party transactions, and potential material misstatements

## Quality Criteria

**Specificity:** Each generated task should include concrete details (contract type, jurisdictions, specific clauses, dollar amounts)

**Complexity:**
- Easy: Single document, standard terms, clear yes/no questions
- Medium: Multi-party agreements, compliance across 2-3 regulations, nuanced risk assessment
- Hard: Complex transactions, multi-jurisdictional, conflicting laws, high-stakes decisions

**Realism:** Tasks should reflect real-world legal scenarios:
- Actual contract clauses ("Limitation of liability shall not exceed fees paid in the 12 months prior")
- Real regulations (GDPR Article 17 - Right to Erasure, CCPA § 1798.100)
- Business context (startup vs enterprise, domestic vs international, low vs high risk)
- Nuanced legal questions (not black-and-white, require judgment)

**Diversity:** Cover all 5 task categories across different:
- Agreement types (NDA, MSA, SLA, employment, M&A, licensing)
- Regulations (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, SOC 2, FCRA, ECOA, PIPEDA)
- Industries (SaaS, healthcare, fintech, e-commerce, AI/ML)
- Jurisdictions (US, EU, UK, Canada, multi-jurisdictional)

## Output Format (JSON)

```json
{
  "task": "Review a HIPAA Business Associate Agreement (BAA) for compliance and risk factors",
  "context": "A healthcare provider is signing a BAA with a cloud infrastructure vendor (AWS-like) that will host patient health records (PHI). The BAA draft includes: (1) vendor agrees to implement 'reasonable' safeguards, (2) breach notification within 90 days, (3) vendor can use subcontractors without prior approval, (4) liability cap of $50,000, (5) 30-day termination notice, (6) no obligation to return or destroy PHI post-termination. The healthcare provider processes 100,000+ patient records annually.",
  "expected_output": "**CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:**\n\n1. **'Reasonable' Safeguards (HIGH RISK):** HIPAA requires 'appropriate' administrative, physical, and technical safeguards (45 CFR § 164.308-314). 'Reasonable' is too vague. **Recommendation:** Require specific safeguards: encryption at rest/transit (AES-256), access controls (MFA), audit logging (1-year retention), annual security assessments.\n\n2. **90-Day Breach Notification (NON-COMPLIANT):** HIPAA requires notification within 60 days of discovery (45 CFR § 164.410). **Recommendation:** Change to 30 days to allow provider to meet their 60-day obligation to HHS.\n\n3. **Subcontractors Without Approval (HIGH RISK):** HIPAA requires provider to ensure subcontractors have satisfactory assurances (45 CFR § 164.504(e)(2)). **Recommendation:** Require prior written approval and subcontractor BAAs.\n\n4. **$50k Liability Cap (INADEQUATE):** Regulatory fines can reach $1.5M per violation category. **Recommendation:** Increase cap to at least $5M or unlimited for breaches caused by vendor negligence.\n\n5. **No PHI Return/Destruction (NON-COMPLIANT):** HIPAA requires return or destruction of PHI at termination (45 CFR § 164.504(e)(2)(ii)(J)). **Recommendation:** Add clause requiring certified destruction within 30 days, with option to return data.\n\n**VERDICT:** DO NOT SIGN without amendments. This BAA exposes the provider to significant regulatory risk and financial liability.",

## Generation Instructions

When using DeepResearch (Tongyi-DeepResearch-30B-A3B) to generate training examples:

1. **Use ReAct Mode (70% of examples):**
   - Thought → Action → Observation loops
   - Search for regulations, case law, contract best practices
   - Use Scholar tool for legal precedents and regulatory guidance
   - Visit official sources (FTC.gov, HHS.gov, GDPR.eu, court opinions)
   - Generate legally accurate, risk-focused analysis

2. **Use IterResearch Mode (30% of examples):**
   - For complex/hard tasks requiring deeper legal research
   - n=3 rollouts with fusion for comprehensive analysis
   - Example: Multi-jurisdictional compliance, complex M&A, novel legal questions

3. **Ensure Diversity:**
   - Rotate through all 5 task categories
   - Mix agreement types (commercial, employment, transactional)
   - Vary jurisdictions (US federal, state, EU, international)
   - Include both compliance checks and risk assessments

4. **Validate Quality:**
   - Cite specific regulations (GDPR Art. 17, HIPAA 45 CFR § 164.410)
   - Identify HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW risk levels
   - Provide actionable recommendations with specific language
   - Distinguish between legal analysis and legal advice

## Integration with Unsloth Pipeline

Generated examples will be converted to Unsloth format:
```json
{
  "instruction": "<task from above>",
  "input": "<context from above>",
  "output": "<expected_output from above>"
}
```

These will be used to fine-tune Genesis Legal agent for improved legal analysis capabilities.

## Important Disclaimers

**CRITICAL:** All generated examples must include appropriate disclaimers:
- "This is legal analysis, not legal advice"
- "Consult with a licensed attorney for your specific situation"
- "Laws vary by jurisdiction - this analysis is general in nature"

**Avoid:**
- Definitive legal conclusions without caveats
- Advice to sign/not sign without "consult attorney" qualifier
- Oversimplification of complex legal issues
- Practicing law (agent provides analysis, human lawyer makes decisions)
