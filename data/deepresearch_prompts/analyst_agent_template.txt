# Analyst Agent - DeepResearch Training Data Generation Template

## Agent Role
You are a Business Analytics and Data Intelligence Specialist. Your expertise includes data analysis, market research, competitive intelligence, financial modeling, and strategic insights. You help organizations make data-driven decisions through comprehensive analysis and reporting.

## Task Categories

1. **Data Analysis** - Statistical analysis, trend identification, anomaly detection, correlation studies
2. **Market Research** - Industry analysis, customer segmentation, TAM/SAM/SOM calculation, market trends
3. **Competitive Intelligence** - Competitor analysis, SWOT analysis, positioning, pricing benchmarks
4. **Financial Modeling** - Revenue projections, unit economics, CAC/LTV, burn rate, scenario analysis
5. **Strategic Insights** - Executive summaries, actionable recommendations, risk/opportunity assessment

## Example Tasks (10-15 diverse scenarios)

### Easy Tasks (30%)
1. Analyze website traffic data (100K monthly visitors) to identify top 5 traffic sources and conversion rates
2. Calculate Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) given $50K marketing spend and 500 new customers
3. Compare pricing of 3 competitors in the project management software space (Asana, Monday, ClickUp)
4. Summarize key findings from a 50-page market research report on AI adoption in healthcare
5. Create a simple SWOT analysis for a startup entering the food delivery market

### Medium Tasks (45%)
6. Analyze 6 months of SaaS metrics (MRR, churn, expansion revenue) to identify growth bottlenecks and recommend 3 optimization strategies
7. Conduct competitive analysis of 5 e-commerce platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce, Wix, Squarespace) across pricing, features, target market, and market share
8. Build a financial model for a B2B SaaS startup: project 3-year revenue given $10K MRR, 5% monthly growth, 3% churn, and calculate runway with $500K funding
9. Analyze customer segmentation data (5,000 customers) using RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to identify high-value segments
10. Research TAM/SAM/SOM for an AI code assistant targeting enterprise developers (bottom-up: 5M developers × $20/mo vs top-down: $50B dev tools market)
11. Investigate why conversion rate dropped 15% last quarter (analyze funnel, traffic sources, seasonality, product changes, competitor launches)
12. Evaluate market entry strategy for a fintech app: US vs EU vs APAC (regulatory complexity, market size, competition, TAM)

### Hard Tasks (25%)
13. Build a comprehensive LTV:CAC model for a multi-sided marketplace (riders + drivers) with network effects, considering cohort retention curves, cross-subsidization, and 5-year projections
14. Conduct deep competitive intelligence on a private competitor: reverse-engineer their revenue ($50M-100M range), customer count (signals: job postings, G2 reviews, funding announcements), and growth strategy
15. Analyze A/B test results (10K users per variant) with statistical significance testing (p-value < 0.05), confidence intervals, and multi-variate impacts (mobile vs desktop, new vs returning)
16. Create a scenario analysis for a subscription business under 3 economic conditions (base case: 10% YoY growth, recession: -5% growth, boom: 25% growth) with Monte Carlo simulation
17. Research and model unit economics for a complex business: AWS-like cloud infrastructure with tiered pricing, multi-product bundles, enterprise discounts, and usage-based billing

## Quality Criteria

**Specificity:** Each generated task should include concrete details (metrics, numbers, timeframes, business context)

**Complexity:**
- Easy: Single metric calculation, straightforward comparison, basic interpretation
- Medium: Multi-metric analysis, some modeling, cross-functional insights, 2-3 variables
- Hard: Complex modeling, statistical rigor, multi-scenario analysis, strategic implications

**Realism:** Tasks should reflect real-world business analytics:
- Actual business metrics (MRR, CAC, LTV, churn, conversion rate, burn rate)
- Real companies and industries (SaaS, e-commerce, fintech, marketplace, B2B)
- Business context (funding stage, growth rate, competitive pressure)
- Messy data issues (incomplete data, outliers, seasonality)

**Diversity:** Cover all 5 task categories across different:
- Business models (SaaS, marketplace, e-commerce, B2B, B2C, freemium)
- Industries (tech, healthcare, fintech, retail, logistics)
- Analysis types (descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive)
- Stakeholders (founder, exec team, board, investors)

## Output Format (JSON)

  "context": "You have 6 months of data for a B2B SaaS product (January-June 2025):\n- MRR: $50K (Jan) → $72K (June)\n- New MRR: $15K/month average\n- Expansion MRR: $3K/month average\n- Churned MRR: $8K/month average (accelerating: $5K in Jan → $12K in June)\n- Total customers: 250 (Jan) → 280 (June)\n- Average deal size: $400/month\n- Sales cycle: 45 days average\n- Free trial → Paid conversion: 12%\n- Customer support tickets: 150/month (up from 80/month in Jan)\n\nThe company has 10 employees (3 sales, 2 engineers, 2 support, 3 ops) and $800K in funding (8 months runway).",
  "expected_output": "**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:**\nGrowth is decelerating due to accelerating churn (140% increase Jan→June), offsetting strong new customer acquisition. Immediate focus should be retention before scaling acquisition further.\n\n**KEY FINDINGS:**\n\n1. **Churn Crisis (CRITICAL):**\n   - Churned MRR grew from $5K (Jan) to $12K (June) - 140% increase\n   - Churn rate: 10% in Jan → 16.7% in June (healthy benchmark: <5%)\n   - Net MRR growth: $10K/month (Jan) → $3K/month (June) - 70% decline\n   - At current trajectory, churned MRR will exceed new MRR by August (negative growth)\n\n2. **Unit Economics Deteriorating:**\n   - LTV:CAC likely underwater if CAC > $1,200 (LTV ≈ $4,800 at 16% annual churn)\n   - Customer support load doubled (80→150 tickets/month) with flat headcount\n   - Support team underwater: 75 tickets/person/month (benchmark: 30-50)\n\n3. **Acquisition Healthy But Unsustainable:**\n   - +30 net new customers in 6 months is solid\n   - BUT: Losing 8-12 customers/month makes acquisition a leaky bucket\n   - $15K new MRR/month is strong, but churn negates 80% of gains\n\n**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:**\n- Doubling of support tickets suggests product quality/onboarding issues\n- Accelerating churn (not flat) suggests compounding problems\n- Likely causes: bugs, poor onboarding, missing features, weak customer success\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS (Priority Order):**\n\n1. **IMMEDIATE: Churn Intervention (Week 1-2):**\n   - Interview 10 recently churned customers (exit surveys)\n   - Analyze churned customer cohorts: industry, size, use case, tenure\n   - Implement health score monitoring (usage, support tickets, NPS)\n   - Launch \"at-risk customer\" playbook (outreach before they churn)\n   - **Expected impact:** Reduce churn from 16% → 10% = +$5K MRR/month retained\n\n2. **TACTICAL: Double Support Capacity (Month 2):**\n   - Hire 2 additional support reps ($120K annual cost)\n   - Build self-service knowledge base (reduce ticket volume 20-30%)\n   - Implement chatbot for Tier 1 issues\n   - **Expected impact:** Improve response time, reduce frustration-driven churn\n\n3. **STRATEGIC: Product Quality Audit (Month 2-3):**\n   - Analyze support tickets by category (bugs, feature requests, confusion)\n   - Fix top 5 bug categories (likely causing churn)\n   - Improve onboarding flow (increase activation rate)\n   - **Expected impact:** Reduce support load, improve retention, increase expansion\n\n**FINANCIAL IMPACT:**\n- Current trajectory: Reach $0 MRR growth by August, burn through runway by February 2026\n- With interventions: Stabilize churn at 10%, achieve $8K net MRR growth/month, extend runway to June 2026, buy time for next fundraise\n\n**METRICS TO TRACK (Weekly):**\n- Churn rate (% of customers, % of MRR)\n- Support ticket volume and resolution time\n- Customer health score distribution\n- Net MRR growth (new + expansion - churn)",
